### Not a project! Just curious about the nodejs, react and mongo.

---

There are 3 components:
* frontend `>>>` React Single Page Application (SPA)
* backend  `>>>` Nodejs REST API service
* MongoDB  `>>>` Database for data.

All components are **dockerized** and set up a networking between them allowing to communicate with each other.

Pseudo-Schema:
